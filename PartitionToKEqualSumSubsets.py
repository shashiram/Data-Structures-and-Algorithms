Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

    Input: nums = [4,3,2,3,5,2,1], k = 4
    Output: true
    Explanation: It is possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

    4*sum=20
